<h3>IT208 .NET Framework</h3>

    Final Project
    
    Create a web site  that allows you to view, insert , update and delete database records using ASP.Net Web Forms.
    Each page should use a Master Page. Include a background image and a CSS style sheet with at least 3 styles. 
    (You can use Bootstrap if you want) The database should store 6 fields of your choice.
    
    The Default.aspx page should display all records, and another page (which could be named something like insertEntry).
    All database fields should be required; this should be done through field validation and page validation.
    All fields should be validated using validation form controls.
